**Intelligent Post-Harvest Warehouse Optimization Framework**

---

## 📌 Original Problem Statement

### Post-Harvest Storage Inefficiency and Supply Chain Losses

A significant portion of agricultural produce in India is lost after harvest due to inadequate storage infrastructure, poor environmental monitoring, fragmented warehouse management, and lack of real-time inventory visibility.

### Key Challenges Faced by Farmers and Aggregators

- ❌ Absence of temperature and humidity monitoring
- ❌ Overstocking or underutilization of storage units
- ❌ Limited traceability of stored produce
- ❌ Delayed detection of spoilage conditions
- ❌ Poor coordination between warehouses and market demand

### Resulting Impact

These inefficiencies lead to:

- 📉 Post-harvest losses
- 💰 Reduced farmer income
- 🚨 Supply chain disruptions
- 📊 Price volatility in markets

Despite the expansion of agricultural warehousing and cold storage networks, many facilities lack intelligent monitoring and optimization systems.

### 🎯 Challenge Statement

**Design a scalable and data-driven warehouse management framework that optimizes agricultural storage conditions, inventory tracking, and distribution planning to minimize post-harvest losses and improve supply chain efficiency.**

---

## 🚀 Our Solution: AgriStore AI

AgriStore AI is a **scalable, data-driven warehouse intelligence framework** designed to reduce post-harvest losses through:

- ✅ Real-time environmental monitoring
- ✅ Batch-level inventory intelligence
- ✅ Spoilage risk prediction
- ✅ Smart storage allocation
- ✅ Demand-aligned dispatch optimization

It acts as a **decision-support layer** that can integrate with existing agricultural warehouses, cold storages, and distribution hubs.

## 🧠 Core Innovation

Instead of building just a warehouse dashboard, we built:

> **An intelligent optimization engine that continuously analyzes storage conditions, inventory age, demand signals, and capacity utilization to minimize spoilage and improve supply chain efficiency.**

---

## 🏗 System Architecture

### Frontend

- **React**
- **TypeScript**
- **Tailwind CSS**

### Backend

- **Node.js**
- **Express.js**
- **REST APIs**

### Core Modules

- 🔴 Risk Scoring Engine
- 🌡️ Environmental Monitoring Engine
- 📦 Dispatch Optimization Module
- 📊 Warehouse Utilization Analyzer

---

## 🔍 Key Features

### 1️⃣ Batch-Level Inventory Tracking

Each incoming batch is tracked with:

- 👨‍🌾 Farmer ID
- 🥕 Produce type
- 🕐 Arrival timestamp
- ⏳ Shelf life
- 🌡️ Ideal storage conditions
- 📊 Current environmental data
- 📦 Quantity
- 🏢 Warehouse zone

**This ensures end-to-end traceability.**

---

### 2️⃣ Spoilage Risk Scoring Engine

Each batch is dynamically assigned a **risk score** based on:

- ⏰ Storage duration vs shelf life
- 🌡️ Temperature deviation
- 💧 Humidity deviation
- 📈 Demand velocity

**This enables:**

- 🚨 Early intervention
- 🎯 Priority-based dispatch
- ♻️ Reduced wastage

---

### 3️⃣ Environmental Monitoring & Alerts

- 🌡️ Continuous temperature tracking
- 💧 Humidity tracking
- 🚨 Threshold-based alert system
- 📊 Risk score auto-adjustment

**Addresses:**

- ✅ Absence of temperature and humidity monitoring
- ✅ Delayed detection of spoilage conditions

---

### 4️⃣ Smart Warehouse Utilization

- 🗺️ Zone-wise capacity tracking
- 📊 Utilization percentage
- ⚠️ Overstock detection
- 💤 Idle capacity identification

**Prevents:**

- ❌ Overstocking
- ❌ Underutilization

---

### 5️⃣ Demand-Aligned Dispatch Optimization

The system:

1. 🔍 Identifies high-risk batches
2. 🎯 Matches supply with high-demand zones
3. 📋 Suggests optimized dispatch plan

**This improves:**

- 🤝 Coordination between warehouses and markets
- 🚚 Supply chain efficiency
- 📉 Loss minimization

---

## 📊 Dashboard Overview

- 📦 **Total Inventory Overview**
